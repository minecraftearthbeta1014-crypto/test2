TASK: Create a fully self-contained, downloadable study-guide and quiz-practice application for college students preparing for an EDEC 303 final exam. The app must function on Mac, Windows, and, if possible, iPhone, using the simplest technology that ensures easy use for non-tech-savvy students. It must not require terminal knowledge or complex installation. Provide one downloadable file or installer per platform.
APP GOAL: To give students an all-in-one tool that includes: • a complete, organized study guide • interactive quizzes • practice questions by topic • flashcards • explanations and feedback • randomized practice • progress tracking (lightweight—not complex) • navigable modules • clean, simple UI designed for clarity
The content of the study guide, quizzes, and flashcards must be built using all information provided below. The app may summarize material when appropriate, but nothing from the provided content should be omitted from consideration.
Organize the content in whatever structure is most readable, efficient, and pedagogically sound. If the app determines a better structure than strict module order, it may choose it.
The final app must be optimized for college students studying to become teachers. Tone of the app’s content should be student-friendly, but the instructions inside this prompt must remain neutral/formal.
────────────────────────────────── CONTENT TO INCLUDE (Use ALL content exactly as provided. You may reorganize or condense as needed for the app.) ──────────────────────────────────
QUIZ 1 MATERIAL • Community of Learners presentation (full content) • Five Steps of Problem Solving: – Define the Problem – Brainstorm Ideas – Decide on a Solution – Implement the Solution – Review the Results • Eight Standards for Mathematical Practice (Include full descriptions, bullet points, behaviors, skills, and examples exactly as provided in the source text.)
QUIZ 2 CORRECT ANSWERS & CONCEPTS COVERED (Use these for practice questions, explanations, and models.)
1. Developmental characteristics of students
2. Objectives must be measurable, observable, student-centered, but not required to be tied to a mathematical procedure
